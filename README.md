# SMBIC

This work provides a novel subsampling-based modified Bayesian information criterion (SM-BIC) for identifying the number of communities in a network generated via the stochastic block model and degree-corrected stochastic block model. 


Specifically, in the Function folder, we provide the useful functions used to apply SM-BIC method for SBM and DCSBM model, respectively. Furthermore, the demo.py file shows how to use this functions.
